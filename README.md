# IMPORTANT: Not official DHIS2 documentation

This is my master thesis, where I attempt to create a tutorial for developing user interfaces in DHIS2. For now, I am only focusing on creating content for DHIS Components and Color courses. Therefore, it is not possible to click on the "start course" button for the other courses. I still have to add in a lot more content to the courses
